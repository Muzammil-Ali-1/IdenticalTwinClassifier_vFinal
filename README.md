# IdenticalTwinClassifier_vFinal
A convolutional neural network written in Python, using Keras, that was designed to classify between my twin brother and I with an accuracy >70%, but ultimately attained an accuracy of ~95%

There are four items of interest in this repository:

1) IdenticalTwinClassifier.py: The actual source code for the CNN architecture
2) accuracy_last_four_epochs.PNG: a screenshot of the Python kernel output displaying, 
    among other things, the accuracy of the CNN over the training set
3) single_prediction_images: a folder containing individual images of my twin and I that most everyone has problems identifying between
4) single_prediction_results.txt: a text file showing the results of the CNN when given the single_prediction_images as input
